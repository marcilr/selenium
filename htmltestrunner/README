  HTMLTestRunner

  "By default, the Python Unittest library emits the test output
  on the terminal console.  If you want to share the results with
  management and stakeholders, then sending console logs isn’t
  the appropriate way.

  So you need to generate a report which looks presentable and
  professional.  A summary report formatted nicely, with
  drill-down access to the details is what required.

  Since the unit test library doesn’t have the ability to produce
  such a report, so you should use the HTMLTestRunner extension."
