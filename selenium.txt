Selenium - Web Browser Automation


What is Selenium?
=================
Selenium automates browsers.  That's it! What you do with that
power is entirely up to you.  Primarily, it is for automating web
applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited
to just that.  Boring web-based administration tasks can (and
should!) be automated as well.

Selenium has the support of some of the largest browser vendors
who have taken (or are taking) steps to make Selenium a native
part of their browser.  It is also the core technology in
countless other browser automation tools, APIs and frameworks.
