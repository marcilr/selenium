Glossary for selenium


Selenium automates browsers.  That's it! What you do with
    that power is entirely up to you.  Primarily, it is for
    automating web applications for testing purposes, but
    is certainly not limited to just that.  Boring web-based
    administration tasks can (and should!) be automated as
    well.

    Selenium has the support of some of the largest browser 
    vendors who have taken (or are taking) steps to make
    Selenium a native part of their browser.  It is also the
    core technology in countless other browser automation
    tools, APIs and frameworks.
