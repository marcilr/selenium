WebDriver


If you want to
o create robust, browser-based regression
  automation suites and tests

o scale and distribute scripts across many
  environments


Then you want to use Selenium WebDriver; a collection
of language specific bindings to drive a browser --
the way it is meant to be driven.

Selenium WebDriver is the successor of Selenium Remote
Control which has been officially deprecated.  The
Selenium Server (used by both WebDriver and Remote
Control) now also includes built-in grid capabilities.
