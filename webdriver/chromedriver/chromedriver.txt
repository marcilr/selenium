ChromeDriver


WebDriver is an open source tool for automated testing of
webapps across many browsers.  It provides capabilities for
navigating to web pages, user input, JavaScript execution,
and more.  ChromeDriver is a standalone server that implements
the W3C WebDriver standard[1].  ChromeDriver is available
for Chrome on Android and Chrome on Desktop (Mac, Linux,
Windows and ChromeOS).  

You can view the current implementation status of the WebDriver
standard here.[2]
