Installation of ChromeDriver for web page existence testing


1. Ensure Chromium/Google Chrome is installed in a
   recognized location
   --Getting started
     https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/getting-started

   "For any driver that Selenium must use to open
   the browser (chromedriver, geckodriver, etc),
   you don't have to worry about where it is installed,
   as long as it's set in the PATH variable.
   ...
   Then you can just instantiate it as follows:

   WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
     OR
   WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();"
